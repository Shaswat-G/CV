# Current Linekedin Profile (to update, redesign, rephrase, polish and optimize):

I am Shaswat, a graduate student pursuing my MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

Previously, I worked full-time as a Data Scientist at AB-InBev for one year. I heavily used SQL for advanced data querying, Python for building and automating machine learning models, and Power BI for dashboarding.

Internship experiences :

1) Data Science @AB-InBev: Developed a product recommendation engine targeting $ 6 million in sales growth across 18,500+ customers in Tanzania. Used latent-factor-based singular value decomposition and non-negative matrix factorization recommenders with custom-built user-interaction matrices. (Advanced Python, Microsoft Azure)

2) Analytics @Glenmark Pharma: Saved 1000+ man-hours/year by automating the reporting of forecast KPIs for 5000+ SKUs in 20+ countries. Implemented a cloud-based repository with automated data validation protocols. (Intermediate Python, Microsoft Azure)

3) Data Science @Protium: Engineered an automated loan-optimization framework and recommendation engine for 350+ small enterprises. Used Google-Maps-API and K-means clustering to improve sales-force allocation in 6 metropolitan cities. Built a pipeline to analyze investment returns on debt instruments statistically. (Advanced Python and Google Cloud)

4) Rephrase.AI: Developed feature validation tests for videos rendered by generative-adversarial networks (Advanced Python, Amazon Web Services).


Quantitative Research Projects:

1) The World Bank Group and KPMG for market sizing, growth forecasting, and investment return modeling of green hydrogen technologies across Southeast Asia.

2) Executive Director and Prof. Sarang Deo @The Indian School of Business to build an epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 infection transmissions in Indian agricultural markets.

3) Prof. Shantanu Tripathi @IIT Bombay to design a modern vertical farm with biomass optimization using computer vision with hydroponics. Awarded the O.P. Jindal Scholarship for Engineering Excellence.


International Exposure:
1) Spent 6 months as an International Exchange Scholar at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
2) Contributed as a delegate to International Conferences like Harvard HPAIR and Princeton Business Today.

# About me section on my website:
I am a technical professional with exceptional academic credentials and proven industry experience, positioned at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and quantitative analysis. As a gold medalist graduating with the highest GPA (9.6/10) and Rank 1 from IIT Bombay, followed by pursuing an MSc in Computer Science (5.25/6 GPA) with Machine Intelligence specialization at ETH Zürich (QS #1 in Europe for CS), my academic trajectory demonstrates both intellectual capability and sustained excellence.
This academic foundation is complemented by substantive professional experience including a successful tenure as a Data Scientist at AB InBev where I delivered $2.4M in annual savings through advanced time-series forecasting and optimization models, earning two company awards within my first year. My technical versatility is further evidenced through five diverse internships across tech, finance, and healthcare sectors—each culminating in full-time offers—and rigorous research contributions at ETH Zürich's Medical Data Science Group and Technology Innovation Management chair.

Beyond technical proficiency, I bring exceptional communication abilities honed through international collaborations and recognized journalism work. As an IIT Bombay Journalism Color Award recipient (one of only two among 10,000+ students) and delegate to prestigious conferences including Harvard HPAIR and Princeton Business Today, I've demonstrated the ability to translate complex technical concepts across diverse audiences.

This unique combination of quantitative excellence and communication skills, validated through multiple merit scholarships (KC Mahindra, Heyning-Roelli, OPJEMS) and Mensa International membership, positions me to not only architect sophisticated technical solutions but also effectively advocate for their business value—making me an ideal candidate for roles requiring both analytical depth and strategic thinking.

Adding a photos section is a great idea to add personality and a human touch to your site. Both options you mentioned are valid, and the best choice depends on your goals and how prominent you want the photos to be:

1. Separate Photo Gallery Page
Pros:
Keeps the homepage clean and focused on your professional brand.
Allows you to showcase a larger collection of photos, organized by themes (e.g., conferences, travels, hobbies).
Visitors interested in knowing more about you personally can explore at their own pace.
Cons:
Less immediate; some visitors may miss it if they don’t navigate to the gallery.
2. Homepage Slideshow/Carousel
Pros:
Instantly adds warmth and personality to your homepage.
Engages visitors right away and makes your site more memorable.
Works well for a small, curated set of photos (e.g., 3–6 images).
Cons:
Can distract from your professional content if not balanced well.
Limited space for context or captions.
Recommendation:
If your primary goal is to keep the homepage professional and focused, add a small, tasteful carousel (3–4 images) to the homepage and link to a full gallery page for those who want to see more. This gives you the best of both worlds: immediate personality and deeper engagement for interested visitors.

Example:

Homepage: “A glimpse into my journey” carousel with 3–4 photos (with short captions).
Separate “Photo Gallery” page: Full collection, organized by theme or timeline.
Let me know if you want sample code for a Jekyll-compatible photo carousel or gallery!
